            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Hello Friends and Family of Aliese,<br>
                    <br>
                    We so appreciate all the support we are receiving. It is heartening to know so many people care for
                    Aliese. We thought this might be a way to help folks know how she is doing until she is able to
                    communicate that to you on her own.&nbsp; Hopefully that will be soon. Below is some information
                    about what has been going on the past 48 hours.<br>
                    <br>
                    Wednesday evening Aliese was in a bicycle&nbsp;accident on a paved country road near Harrisonburg.
                    She was not hit by a vehicle and only remembers braking and going over the handlebars.&nbsp; She was
                    able to walk to a nearby house for help and call Ethan.&nbsp; She received good care from the home
                    owners and a nurse that stopped to assist.<br>
                    <br>
                    She was transported to the local hospital by ambulance. There the staff determined that she may have
                    sustained a fracture to her larynx, the cartilage around her vocal cords. She experienced
                    significant swelling and they had to intubate her (breathing tube) to make sure she had a good
                    airway.&nbsp; Ethan was allowed to see her in the ER which the staff reported was very helpful in
                    easing her distress.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">She was airlifted to University of
                    Virginal Medical Center where they have specialists able to treat her injuries. They took her to
                    surgery early Thursday morning to try to repair the injury to her larynx and assess damage to her
                    vocal cords. We got word at 1:30 from the surgeon that he was able to repair the fracture with
                    titanium plates. She is back in the surgical ICU.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">She also broke her jaw in three places.
                    The Facial & Plastic Reconstructive Surgery team will be doing surgery this afternoon to repair
                    that. If that goes well they anticipate moving her out of ICU tomorrow.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Of course COVID is complicating the
                    ability to visit her. Ethan was able to see her last evening and we could communicate briefly
                    through video chat.&nbsp; She is on a respirator at this point and writes notes on a white board to
                    communicate</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Please hold Aliese in your thoughts and
                    prayers. She has some difficult days ahead.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Friday morning update.&nbsp; Ethan
                    was with Aliese from 5-9 last night.&nbsp; She can have one 4 hour visit every six days while in
                    ICU.&nbsp; Not much, but thankful for that.&nbsp; We were able to see her with a brief video chat,
                    so that was comforting. During the time she is awake she is pretty coherent which is also reassuring
                    to us.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">We awoke at 6:30 am to a text from
                    Aliese with a video one of the nurses had taken.&nbsp; It showed her breathing on her own (without
                    the ventilator).&nbsp; She has a tracheostomy (tube in her neck) to maintain an airway and allow her
                    larynx and vocal cords to rest and heal. She has stitched lacerations on her face and lots of
                    swelling but getting to see her was so great. We even got a glimpse of our funny girl when the next
                    text from her said, “I pooped! Just thought you would want to be the first to know.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">We got word from the Doc that the
                    Facial Reconstructive team will do surgery on her jaw this afternoon.&nbsp; If that goes well, they
                    anticipate she can leave ICU tomorrow for a regular room. That is ahead of the schedule they talked
                    about yesterday, also good news. We hope that means she might be allowed a visitor more often but we
                    understand and appreciate how careful the hospital is being.&nbsp; Earl and I are staying put for
                    now. She is getting great care from the medical staff and her beloved big brother.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span
                        style="font-size: 14pt;">Thanks for the prayers and words of support.&nbsp; And thanks for all
                        you are doing to keep the curve flat.&nbsp; We are so thankful there was a ventilator available
                        for Aliese!</span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">4:30 (CST) Friday. Aliese is out of
                    surgery to repair her jaw.<span>&nbsp;</span> The surgeon said it went well.<span>&nbsp;</span> They
                    had to place pins behind her canine teeth and the corresponding molars on the bottom. Then they
                    literally wired her jaw shut.<span>&nbsp;</span> The surgeon explained that the fractures on both
                    sides of her lower jaw were so near the mandibular joint that he was not able to plate the jaw to
                    fix it. Wiring it in place allows the jaw to heal in a position as close to pre-crash as possible.
                    He said that the force of the impact must have been powerful to cause the fractures.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span
                        style="font-size:14pt;">Yesterday afternoon Ethan spoke with the homeowner that assisted Aliese
                        after the accident.<span>&nbsp;</span> He was outside and did not see the accident but saw her
                        approach his house.<span>&nbsp;</span> He thought at first she had a red bandana on, but as she
                        neared he saw that it was blood.<span>&nbsp;</span> Aliese told him she had a bike accident and
                        asked if she could sit in his driveway. She did not want them to call an ambulance but it became
                        clear to them she needed one.<span>&nbsp;</span> We are amazed given her injuries and what the
                        doctors have told us that she was able to walk to help. The human body has such incredible power
                        to override the injuries and pain she was experiencing.<br>
                        <br></span></span> <span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span
                        style="font-size:14pt;">If all goes well tonight in ICU they will transfer her to a regular room
                        tomorrow. She told us before surgery that she was looking forward to the nurse being able to put
                        food in the NG tube because she is so hungry. We were able to communicate via video call,
                        Aliese’s notepad and hand gestures. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;</span></span>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Saturday morning</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">We haven’t had a report on Aliese
                    since speaking with the doctors at 5pm yesterday.<span>&nbsp;</span> They would not allow Ethan to
                    visit her last night.<span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>At seven o’clock this morning we got a
                    picture of Aliese sitting up in a chair. What a great sight!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">When we spoke with the OR nurse caring
                    for Aliese in surgery yesterday she mentioned how great Aliese is.<span>&nbsp;</span> She said
                    Aliese had her laughing and she thinks she may have gotten Aliese’s life story before she succumbed
                    to the anesthesia.<span>&nbsp;</span> I am sure you can imagine Aliese with some happy juice on
                    board. And remember, Aliese was communicating this only on the notepad and using gestures. Her
                    Laryngologist called shortly after we spoke with that nurse to give us his report for the day. He
                    also mentioned how amazing Aliese is, asking good questions, writing notes of thanks and showing
                    regard for the staff.<span>&nbsp;</span> More than once he said that was rare and expressed his
                    appreciation of her. We are so proud of her.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The report from the nurse this
                    afternoon was that Aliese was up in the chair several times today.<span>&nbsp;</span> The Head &
                    Neck team doc took one of the drains out (from the repair on her larynx) which the nurse indicated
                    was a positive thing. The drain was required because the fracture of her larynx caused a laceration
                    into her throat, thankfully missing her vocal cord. The repair of that laceration meant extra time
                    in surgery on Thursday and extra care as she heals. The Laryngologist told us early on that this
                    type of injury was not common.<span>&nbsp;</span> After surgery I asked him how Aliese’s injury
                    compared to others he has repaired.<span>&nbsp;</span> He said on a four scale (four the worst)
                    Aliese was a three. As she headed into surgery we were told of the possibility that the surgery
                    might not be able to repair the injury and that a permanent tracheostomy could be
                    necessary.<span>&nbsp;</span> We were so relieved to hear the surgeon say he felt confident about
                    his repair. She has been off the ventilator for 48 hours and now breathing on her own (through the
                    tracheostomy).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">She had a follow up head CT that was
                    fine. She has orders to transfer her from SICU to the Intermediate Surgical Care floor and they
                    waited all day for a bed to become available. At 9:30 pm (CST) the nurse made a video call for
                    Aliese so she could tell us goodnight.<span>&nbsp;</span> She will spend another night in
                    SICU.<span>&nbsp;</span> Not sure how Aliese feels about that, but this mom appreciates all the eyes
                    and technology she will have on her for one more night.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Sunday morning.<span>&nbsp;</span> We
                    got a call from the nurse this morning telling us they were getting ready to move Aliese to the
                    intermediate floor. She said Aliese had a pretty good night and that they were so impressed at her
                    progress given her injuries. A few minutes later we got a short video of Aliese walking a few steps
                    with a walker.<span>&nbsp;</span> Her nurse was by her side to steady her and move along all the
                    “stuff” hooked up to Aliese. We could hear the PT in the background cheering her on. They said they
                    were going to miss caring for her. My nephew was an ICU nurse for several years and when he heard
                    the comments on the video he texted to Aliese, “When the nurse says, ‘We’re going to miss you when
                    you go to the floor’, I know exactly what she means. You are the type of patient who makes nurses
                    know we are appreciated and gives us energy to keep doing the job”.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">She was transferred to room 6173 at
                    UVA Health, 1215 Lee Street, Charlottesville, VA, 22903. Her Laryngologist thought she would not be
                    discharged for at least a week but said she has surprised him so far.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Sunday evening. Aliese texted her list
                    of accomplishments today, walking, moving out of ICU and sleeping and not forgetting to breath. It
                    was a big day.&nbsp;She also shared, “I developed a system of pulling my own hair to lift my head
                    up”. She said that she has been afraid that she would die but now is mostly able to believe that
                    isn’t going to happen. The move from ICU was welcome, but without all the commotion and procedures
                    the enormity of what happened and the healing road ahead is overwhelming her. Luckily it comes in
                    waves, affording her some moments of calm and gratitude.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">She would like prayers for peaceful
                    sleep as she said much of her sleep is filled with nightmares.<span>&nbsp;</span> She texted, “I
                    also want you to put on the page for prayers for peace for my family (parents especially) since I
                    know it’s very hard on them not to be able to support me in person”. So true, stupid COVID!</span>

            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #222222;">Monday: Nightmare free
                    last night, but only because Aliese’s brain kept her awake conjuring endless worries, hurdles and
                    outcomes. At 7 am her Laryngologist saw her and deflated a “balloon” in the tracheostomy allowing
                    secretions to flow into her trachea. A short time later we got texts from Aliese saying she was
                    having trouble breathing, felt like she was drowning and was really scared. We placed a frantic call
                    to the nurse who explained that this was normal but added that this stage is really awful for her.
                    We were able to communicate that to Aliese and assure her they were monitoring her oxygen
                    carefully.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #222222;">Her Laryngologist called
                    us with his report at 7:30. He concurred with the nurse and assured us that Aliese was making great
                    progress. He said she was able to cough and hum which demonstrated some basic function of her vocal
                    cords.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">He reminded us last
                    Friday that he mentioned he would have the Speech Therapist work with Aliese at the end of this week
                    on assessing her ability to swallow safely.&nbsp; He said he is pleased with her progress and put in
                    the order for that assessment which happened today. Aliese reported that she got to take a sip of
                    water.</span><span
                    style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span> <span
                    style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">She is scheduled for a
                    swallow test tomorrow. She has to be able to safely take enough calories through a straw before they
                    can remove the NG tube.<br></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #222222;">She is absolutely
                    exhausted and says sleep is hard to come by when buried under mounds of tubes, discomfort and drugs.
                    “Please pray for sleep. Also pray for my family and friends as they walk through such uncertainty
                    with me. And for my physicians and nurses who work so hard for me.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span><span
                    style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The nurse called Ethan
                    and said the visitation policy is one visit on the 7th day after admission to the floor.&nbsp; She
                    was able to get an exception made for Ethan to visit on Wednesday.<br>

            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">Today’s update comes from
                    Aliese via texts sent throughout the day.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">Today was better than
                    yesterday. I slept more last night. Throughout the day I don’t get much sleep because of constant
                    interruptions from nurses, physicians and therapy staff. I had a swallow test which I passed.
                    Swallowing is super difficult, though. The goal is for me to drink 5 Ensures each day in order to
                    get off the feeding tube. Today I drank one and that felt exhausting and it took FOREVER. (Cue
                    Sandlot flashback). [The picture is Aliese being handed her first Ensure. So good to see an Aliese
                    expression]</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">I smashed it out of the
                    park with PT. Walked independently, walked all alone with arms crossed, walked backwards, did stairs
                    frontwards and backwards and frontwards by two. I also showed off and did a bit of (very lame/slow)
                    solo dancing. I guess I'm not the perfect humble Mennonite. But I gotta have fun however I can in
                    here.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">My vision is still wonky.
                    Good sleep still feels rare. Lots of coughing and suctioning.&nbsp;Was able to see inside my mouth
                    in the mirror today and it is WICKED in there. Like a ninja warrior obstacle course but
                    scarier.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">S</span><span
                    style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">eems likely that I'll be
                    discharged on Thursday. That feels exciting and scary, like most new things these days.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Everyone says I'm
                    progressing very quickly. That's good to hear but doesn't allay my fears when I think about
                    long-term. Still feels overwhelming and discouraging thinking about all that lies ahead.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">From Mom-We are so
                    thankful for all her progress. Thank you for all the thoughts, prayers and expressions of love and
                    caring. Today Ethan shared a picture he took of Aliese right before she was loaded into the
                    helicopter.&nbsp; He had refused to show us before now and I am glad he didn’t. We were fearful
                    enough.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;">We were so encouraged to
                    see this picture of Aliese today. I would add that her expression is very similar to that of Ethan’s
                    when I shared that he would have the “opportunity” to support his sister by learning how to assist
                    her with her trach care. When I told Aliese the nursing staff would train some care partners for
                    her, her text response was, “Can I have a therapy pony?” I was attempting to reply that she could
                    have anything she wants when Ethan responded that he was not going to clean up pony poop. And so it
                    begins.</span></p>

        <div data-qa="postBody-68cd0a64-0442-3015-a48f-70097de73b50" class="jsx-2325027717 postBody">
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It has been one week since we got a call from
                    Ethan that began, “Aliese is ok but she has been in a bike accident”. It seems important to mark
                    that passage of time. Today was difficult for Aliese. As her discharge nears there is a flurry of
                    tests, and checks, and learning and practicing. That also meant very little time for precious sleep.
                    (Discharge tomorrow or Friday)</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The biggest hurdle is trying to consume
                    enough calories orally to sustain good healing.<span>&nbsp;</span> Sipping through a straw is
                    difficult and swallowing is uncomfortable. Going home with an NG tube feels like defeat to my
                    warrior daughter despite her doctor’s reassurance.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Ethan was allowed a four hour visit today
                    which came just in time to offer comfort and reassurance to Aliese. We were thankful to see Ethan
                    next to a (sort of) smiling Aliese rather than picturing him next to her in the ER. He learned how
                    to assist with her trach care should she need it.<span>&nbsp;</span> As you might expect of Aliese,
                    she has pretty much mastered that.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">As her doctor gave us his update today he
                    explained that he told Aliese he believed her physical injuries would heal well given time. She is
                    very worried about her voice restoration and that is still unknown. He told her that the emotional
                    impact of the trauma may be the most difficult part of her healing and urged her not to minimize or
                    ignore it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Her fear of dying, especially once out of the
                    watchful eyes of the nursing staff, is paralyzing at times. I can’t imagine that being provided wire
                    cutters and instructed how to cut the wires securing her jaw in order to maintain her airway (should
                    she vomit) did much for allaying her fear.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">“My prayer request in the days to come is
                    primarily for bravery and peace of mind. Being discharged feels like cutting off my lifeline. I‘ve
                    never felt so physically vulnerable before, so I ask for my support network to send me strength from
                    afar such that I can do the right thing to continue speedy recovery and also be kind to
                    myself”</span></p>

            Noon news. They are planning to discharge Aliese today.&nbsp; So many people have offered prayers and asked
            about how to help.&nbsp; We have an immediate need for Aliese to have an air horn or some such loud device
            that she can activate to summon help if she needs it.&nbsp; The one I ordered won't arrive until
            Saturday.&nbsp; If anyone has one to loan and could drop it off on her porch, please reply here and I will
            email you back to confirm. That way she won't return to a house with a dozen air horns outside the
            door.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Nine p.m. Eastern Time and Ethan is helping
                    load Aliese and numerous bags of medical supplies into the car for the trip back to Harrisonburg. A
                    week ago we would have never believed she would be at this point. <span>&nbsp;</span>I think
                    together they plotted how to get Aliese every last minute in the care of the nursing staff. Both are
                    anxious for a visit from the home health agency that will assure them everything is properly
                    arranged and hooked up. <span>&nbsp;</span>It sounds like instructions are for someone to keep a
                    pretty close eye on her while she has the tracheostomy. COVID complicates that, as she is at
                    increased risk right now. Otherwise Mama and Papa Bear would have been in Virginia about 15 hours
                    after getting the phone call from Ethan.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The nutritionist switched her liquid food to
                    one that requires less volume and had her use a syringe rather than a straw. That improved the
                    outlook for adequate sustenance so they removed her NG tube. Aliese texted that it felt so good to
                    have it out. They added a week to the timeline for unwiring her jaw and the liquid diet.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Thanks for all your prayers. She (and Ethan)
                    probably need some extra ones for courage tonight.<span>&nbsp;</span> I uploaded a picture of Aliese
                    after her very first surgery. I’ll bet she was secretly hoping for a cool certificate this time as
                    well. The other picture is of Aliese behind her dad on her Tag-a-long bike. It was the beginning of
                    her love of cycling. And the last is of Aliese waiting in her hospital bed for Ethan to
                    arrive.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Hello from Aliese herself!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Day one at home has been a success of sorts.
                    It's been alright. Kinda sucked. Here's the shakedown:</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Negatives:</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Not much sleep last night.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Everything is such a freaking PROCESS. Even a
                    simple thing like drinking a Nepro (nasty high-protein/high-calorie "food" shake thingy) is actually
                    quite laborious and time-consuming.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Things hurt or are uncomfortable a lot.
                    Generally, not a huge deal, but when compounded with other things not going well, is definitely a
                    recipe for tears of frustration.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Positives:</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I'm alive! That sounds pretty basic. When we
                    (physicians, family, me) first started talking about discharge from the hospital I was totally
                    terrified. Irrationally sure that I would likely die from something small and stupid if I was taken
                    away from the constant monitoring of trained medical professionals. While my fear of dying lingers,
                    it occupies a more rational portion of my brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">My housemates (that includes my brother,
                    Ethan) are the bomb. They are doing so much to support me.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I can still make funny noises. Also, those of
                    you that know how I tend to make dumb noises as I'm completing tasks: all of that now sounds like
                    I'm blowing into the wrong end of a kazoo. Quite comical.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I can smell things. Namely, food. Guh! I'm so
                    pumped to eat real food again! For now, I'm resigned to my iron prison. For the first while, any
                    mention of food made me angry. For now, at least, I am surprised to discover that I do enjoy - or
                    appreciate? - the delicious smells that arise from our house's kitchen.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span
                    style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I have the best support people! I can't say
                    enough how all the words of affirmation (as well as the gifts and flowers and more) have made things
                    better for me. I am so grateful for, and sometimes amazed by, how many people are cheering me on and
                    supporting me from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Many people ask how they can best support me
                    or my housemates. For now, my answer remains: encouragement and prayers. In the many small,
                    difficult moments, I read your reminders that I am capable and badass, and that's what renews me for
                    the next task.&nbsp;Once I'm over the hump of simply surviving, I suspect there may be some things
                    that people can do for me/us. I'll keep you posted.&nbsp;</span></p>

                Monday- Now that I have four days under my belt, my sense of imminent death is mostly subsiding. Hooray!
                Most of my day is spent sleeping interspersed with mundane things that used to be small, life
                maintenance stuff but are now big main events like:
            </div>
            <div>
                • Getting my hair washed and styled by roommates Anna & Katie and putting on cute clothes.&nbsp; I felt
                like a new person.
            </div>
            <div>
                • Going on a slow, wobbly walk around the block.
            </div>
            <div>
                • “Eating” homemade food for the first time in 11 days thanks to Katie.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Beginning to consolidate all my medical stuff so it doesn’t take up a whole room in our house.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Making a plan to mend my Lion King sweatshirt that was cut off me before I was loaded into the
                ambulance.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Reading cards and appreciating gifts that people have sent me.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Examining the broken/bloody items that survived my crash.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;And then there are the new tasks of daily living: eating with my jaw wired shut, taking
                medications and trach care.<br>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div>
                I finally got a visit from the Home Health nurse on Saturday. She provided lots of helpful and
                reassuring information.&nbsp; Since arriving home I had really bad headaches. She reminded me I have a
                concussion and need to limit screen time and reading. That sucks because screens are my only mode of
                communication with non-roommates. But, headaches suck worse.<br>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div>
                I still really enjoy getting messages and updates from you all. Voice messages are great because I don’t
                have to look at a screen and I get to hear your lovey voice. If that is not your thing, texts, emails
                and cards are all very welcome. Please don’t be offended if my response is brief. You all know I am a
                woman of many words, but for now I have to reign it in so I can get better faster.
            </div>
            <div>
                In the next week or so I hope to post a few updates on:
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Fighting and being a warrior.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;My recovery road ahead.
            </div>
            <div>
                •&nbsp;Doing nothing.
            </div>
            <div>
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Random things I am thankful for: a box fan, back rubs and my own bed.
            </div>
            <div>
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Prayers or good vibes for healing for my vocal cords so I can be loud and wordy again someday and less
                dizziness.&nbsp;
            </div>

            From Aliese, Friday afternoon:<br>
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><br></strong></span><span
                style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>An Afternoon in Grumpytown</strong></span><span
                style="text-decoration:underline;"><br></span>Today I'm grumpy. I've woken up the past three days with a
            horrible headache and a sore mouth. I'm tired all the time, even after waking up from a nap. When I was in
            the hospital I had milestones on a daily basis. First breaths on my own (off the ventilator). First steps.
            Going off oxygen support. Being able to see out of my left eye. Humming for the first time. Doctors and
            nurses were constantly surprised, telling me I was healing faster than anticipated, ahead of
            schedule.&nbsp;<br>
            Since getting home, I've lost the feedback of physicians. I don't have benchmarks to compare my progress to.
            My accomplishments seem small and my progress slow. My scabs are smaller and I can move my face a little
            more. Big whoop.&nbsp;<br>
            For a while, I was surprisingly content doing nothing. I felt relatively at peace. Less angsty, even, than I
            was amid COVID pre-Crash. Not so today. Today I'm angry. Sick of laying around with no reward. Mad that I
            have to wait.....only to have more surgeries again later, meaning more laying around, more "healing", more
            waiting, more nothing.&nbsp;<br>
            Am I done yet? Can I be done now, please?

                style="text-decoration:underline;"><br></span>I guess I should eat my words. (I'll have to liquefy them
            first, though, haha.) Turns out part of my grumpiness earlier today was due to the fact that
            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>, indeed, getting better.<br>
            <br>
            That is, I JUST WANT TO MOVE MY BODY!! Tonight I want nothing more than to go on a bike ride. I want to zoom
            down the street with the wind rushing past me. I want to breathe hard and feel my muscles burn. I want to
            fly downhill with my arms outstretched. I want to go somewhere across town and get there by the power of my
            own two legs.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I also want to do pull-ups (ok, at this point,&nbsp;<em>a</em> pull-up) and yoga and play soccer & tennis,
            or shoot hoops or play catch, and run and jump and climb a tree, go on a hike, go rock climbing, and, of
            course, dance.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The intensity of my desire to move my body, to exercise, seems like probably a sign of progress. So I guess
            I can be grateful for that. Mostly, though, I just want to rip my trach out and run down the street playing
            loud music.&nbsp;<span>😇</span>&nbsp;I promise to refrain from both, though.&nbsp;

            From Aliese on Thursday, May 28th:<br>
            <br>
            While I was in the hospital I jokingly requested a therapy pony as a requisite for being
            discharged.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Earlier this week, Anna (housemate) asked if she could schedule a surprise for me on Thursday. "I'm pretty
            booked doing nothing that day," I wrote to her in response.&nbsp;😉&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Thursday arrived. I woke from a nap in time for my scheduled surprise. I was instructed to put on my masks
            (one to cover my mouth/nose and one to cover my trach) as well as a blindfold. I was then led by Ethan out
            into the yard.<br>
            "Ok, now hold out your hand. Can you guess what it is?" he said.<br>
            As my brain tried to make sense of the fur underneath my fingers, I tentatively guessed "a goat...?" in
            confusion, before it clicked: "A PONY!"<br>
            <br>
            Guys...it was a real pony!!! I literally jumped up and down with joyful surprise.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Turns out some friends from church read about my therapy pony joke, happened to own a pony, and conspired
            with Anna to bring Ellie The Pony to our house for a visit. She may not be trained in therapy, but Ellie
            certainly brought a lot of laughter and joy into my day. I think my heart grew a little.<br>
            <br>
            I hope you enjoy the pictures as much as we enjoyed Ellie's visit.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I really do have the best supporters. :)<br>
            Thanks, Murches. Thanks, housemates. Thanks, Ellie.

            Monday I had my follow-up appointment with my laryngologist. The main purpose was to use a scope to look at
            my vocal cords. For some context: as a result of The Crash (if I'm describing things correctly) I fractured
            my laryngeal cartilage. That was repaired with a titanium plate that will stay in my neck forever. (Hurray
            for more metal.&nbsp;<span class="mce-emoticon">😬) At the same time, the force of the impact caused a small
                tear in one of my vocal cords. That was repaired with a small, absorbable stitch. On Monday, my
                laryngologist used a scope to assess how my vocal cords are doing. Right now, the formerly-torn one is
                still swollen but otherwise looks good. That means that we don't anticipate me needing any further
                surgical interventions on my vocal cords. Aka, they should heal fine on their own, with time. Yay!
                That's great news and a big relief!&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                So what's next?<br>
                <br>
                Next Tuesday, June 9th, I will have surgery to remove the hardware wiring my jaws together (if
                everything looks to be healing how my surgeon wants it to be). Again, for context: during The Crash, I
                fractured my mandible (lower jaw) in two places, very close to each ear. I also fractured my maxilla
                (upper jaw) in the center, underneath my nose. My surgeon repaired the upper jaw fracture with a plate.
                My lower jaw was repositioned (hopefully as close to pre-Crash position as possible) and then wired in
                place to immobilize it for healing (much like a cast for any other broken bone). Hypothetically, on the
                9th they'll find that my lower jaw fractures are healing well and my hardware can be removed. I believe
                there's some chance that I would return home with some type of less restrictive hardware. My hope is
                that after the 9th I won't need any further surgeries to address jaw stuff.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                After that?<br>
                <br>
                Sometime after my jaw has healed more, I'll need oral surgery to replace my many lost, cracked, and
                chipped teeth. I'm not sure yet what all will be involved in that process. I have a couple consultations
                set up for later June and early July.&nbsp;<br>
                Another part of my injuries/treatment/healing is my trach. The day after The Crash, my laryngologist
                performed a tracheostomy for two reasons. First, because my injuries were causing severe swelling in my
                neck, so it was important to install a trach to guarantee a clear airway (aka make sure I'd be able to
                breathe). Second, to remove the breathing tube that the ER doc had placed the night before in order to
                avoid further damage to my vocal cords (as a breathing tube that comes out your mouth passes between
                your vocal cords). I no longer need my trach in order to breathe (though part of my breathing is still
                through the trach). However, for any surgery that requires general anesthesia a breathing tube is used
                and since we want to avoid breathing tubes passing between my vocal cords, my trach needs to stay in
                until I'm done with all surgeries that require general anesthesia. Thus, the date for my trach coming
                out is dependent on how my jaws heal, what kind of sedative/anesthesia is necessary for my oral surgery,
                and when all of that can happen. If the stars align, there's a chance that I could get my trach removed
                at my next laryngology appointment on July 6th. Also on July 6th, I will see a speech pathologist. The
                reason for that is that, as my vocal cords are healing, and as I'm learning to talk with my jaws wired
                shut, there's a good chance that my body is adapting in ways that are helpful right now but potentially
                harmful in the long run. Despite my hatred of speech class in elementary school, I am excited to receive
                speech therapy this time. I know it will be important in returning my voice to pre-Crash function. My
                hope is to be able to talk as much and as loudly as I did before the wreck.&nbsp;<span

            Today I made myself a smoothie using crunchy peanut butter. Despite much blending, there was one peanut
            survivor that I unwittingly sucked up. Said survivor was small enough to make it through the gaps in my
            wires but too big to fit through the gap between my lower teeth and my upper gums (where I used to have
            teeth&nbsp;<span>😭</span>&nbsp;). Stuck in limbo! As a result, I attempted to remove Sir Peanut from his
            iron cage using the stick end of a cotton swab. After a couple minutes of frustrated poking and coaxing, I
            accidentally shoved Sir Peanut into one of my tooth sockets.&nbsp;<span>😱</span>&nbsp; Oh gosh! I have a
            peanut for a tooth! What if it gets stuck there? It's gonna rot my gums out and they won't be able to
            replace my teeth! Frustration turned to exasperation mixed with hearty laughter at the ridiculousness of my
            predicament. Fortunately, after showing off my peanut tooth to Katie and digging around a bit more, I was
            able to coax Sir Peanut out of my gums and release him from iron prison into the Wonderful World of the
            Compost Bucket.&nbsp;<br>
            Tomorrow I will blend my smoothie for longer.&nbsp;<span>😉</span>&nbsp;

            Surgery on Tuesday went well I'm told. I still have arch bars but I'm able to open my mouth.&nbsp;<br>
            Even so, I hate everything.&nbsp;<br>
            Eating is miserable. I'd rather drink Nepro. So I do.&nbsp;<br>
            I'm sick of doing nothing but don't want to do anything, or have energy to.&nbsp;<br>
            I'm sick of all the small discomforts. Sick of being "in recovery."&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I want my teeth back. Can I get my implants tomorrow? (The answer is no...it'll probably take 4 months to
            get implants and crowns.) I'm probably banking on teeth fixing all my misery, which they probably won't. But
            I still want my teeth back - or some fake ones, I guess - sooner than later.<br>
            <br>
            I'm angry most of the time. My indomitable spirit has run out of juice.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            At least I have nice eyebrows.

            Many of you have asked how you can support me.&nbsp;<br>
            I've created <a href="http://www.sokindregistry.org/TheCrash">a registry</a>, mostly to cover the costs of
            things I want to replace. Right now - since none of you have the ability to magically fix my face - what I
            want most is money to get my things back and help me heal. If it would bring you joy to give money towards
            any of the items on my list, feel free to do so. If not, I still appreciate you and your thoughts.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            If you have any questions about the registry, feel free to email me at aliese.gingerich@gmail.com.<br>

            I've officially emerged from my Cloudstorm of Grumpiness and Despair. (In reality it only lasted a few days,
            right after the surgery to get my wires removed.) Certainly I still have moments throughout the day when I
            am overcome by anger or sadness regarding a body part that doesn't work how I want it to. In those moments,
            usually what I want most is to be transported into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuVsskzMRrA"
                target="_blank">this scene from one of my favorite Netflix shows</a>. But for the most part my days have
            been quite positive lately.&nbsp;<span>😊</span>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I saw Dr. C last Monday and when I asked about my facial scars, he said that I have "traumatic tattooing,"
            which basically means there is gravel dust lodged in my face underneath my scars. My first tattoo! Because
            of that, and some other reasons, I'm set to have surgery next Tuesday, June 30th, to get my arch bars off
            and undergo "scar revision" wherein my surgeon will meticulously remove said gravel dust.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I've also had consults with an oral surgeon, an orthodontist, and a dentist. Because of complications with
            my jaw, the process of replacing my teeth will likely take at least 6 months. That definitely sucks,
            especially since we can't even start that process until after my arch bars come off. Guh!&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Eating is less miserable but not much more enjoyable. For the most part, I legitimately do not like food
            anymore. I'm assuming/hoping that will change with time...<br>
            <br>
            I started exercising again last weekend. That has made a big difference in my mood! Also, on Monday after
            doing yoga AND a (very short) run, I succeeded in eating TWO WHOLE SCRAMBLED EGGS with salsa, and I didn't
            even hate it! Yippee!<br>
            <br>
            Upcoming stuff:<br>
            June 30 = outpatient surgery to remove arch bars and do scar revision<br>
            July 1 = consultation with UVA dentistry for second opinion about all my dental stuff<br>
            July 6 = check-up with Dr. M (hopefully getting my trach out
            <span>🙏</span>&nbsp;<span>🙌)</span>&nbsp;+<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;consult with speech pathologist (excited and nervous about that - hoping she'll tell me
            that with some exercises & time I'll be able to get more normal volume, tone, and range back) +<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;check-up with Dr. C about jaw alignment and scar healing<br>
            July 8 = dentist appointment to make a more detailed plan of action (and hopefully start said plan)<br>
            <br>
            After that I think things will be much more spread out (aka..slow).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Other big life news is that I accepted a half-time ESL job back at Waterman. Many of you know I had planned
            to move away this summer to pursue non-teaching career stuff and generally take a break from the 'Burg.
            Between COVID ruining half my hopes and The Crash necessitating me being nearby for surgeries this
            fall/winter, I decided it made more sense to stick around. I'm disappointed, relieved, and
            grateful.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>

            Surgery today went well and was a much funner experience than anticipated! I had requested early on to do
            today's procedures without general anesthesia and without sedation - I like more pain and less drugs.
            Originally I was told that I would have to have at least sedation, but by some stroke of luck today they let
            me do everything with just a few injections of local around my eye/nose/upper lip. I got to be awake the
            whole time and even got to see some of the stuff they removed from my face.&nbsp;<span>😀</span>&nbsp; I was
            able to do the arch bar removal without any drugs at all.&nbsp;<br>
            Certainly, several parts were very uncomfortable but they were all short-lived.&nbsp;<br>
            They played one of my favorite Spotify playlists and I chatted with my surgeon/surgical resident/OR nurses
            throughout most of the time. The procedure took less than half the time it was scheduled for.&nbsp;<br>
            I took one dose of oxycodone when I got home to "get ahead of the pain," but anticipate being able to manage
            with just ibuprofen/tylenol by tomorrow. Aside from general discomfort where they cut me open, and some
            fuzziness from the oxycodone, I feel great! THIS IS WHY I PREFER LOCAL
            ANESTHESIA!&nbsp;<span>😉</span>&nbsp; (I also enjoyed listening to my physicians sing my praises throughout
            the procedure for being "tough as nails," "such a good sport," "not flinching,"
            etc.&nbsp;<span>😎</span>&nbsp; Always a nice ego boost.)&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            It feels SO GREAT to not have my arch bars in any more!&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I'm now allowed to chew! I still don't enjoy food, but I know that will improve with time. I think it will
            help to not have painful hardware in the way and to not have to pick junk out of my arch bars for 10 minutes
            anytime I eat solid foods.<br>
            <br>
            My surgeon also said I can get back on my bike!! I'm going to wait until I get the all-clear from my other
            surgeon, and until my new helmet arrives. But I wasn't expecting that good news today, so that feels like a
            real win.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I expect the next 24 hours or so to be uncomfortable. And I'll probably get annoyed with scars again in the
            coming days/weeks. There's also one nuisance area that was not operable today; I expect that will continue
            to cause me some distress. But, for now, I'm feeling really grateful for my legitimately fun surgery
            experience, for unexpected good news, for tooth freedom, and to be one step closer to dental implants.
            :)<br>
            <br>
            Thanks for your support and prayers!&nbsp;<span>🙏</span>&nbsp;<span>😊</span>&nbsp;

            I have a recessed chin (always have - now it's slightly worse, unless that's my pessimistic imagination),
            which makes me look a bit <strong>turtle</strong>-esque.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            When I eat, I feel like a <strong>lizard</strong> (for some reason, possibly because of my lip immobility, I
            can't keep my mouth closed while I chew + chewing is still strange and sometimes cumbersome).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I got my trach out so until it heals I'll have a blowhole, like a <strong>whale</strong>. (I keep it covered
            with gauze to help with healing and prevent airflow, though.)<br>
            <br>
            Also, Anna and Stefan's eggplant burgers looked like <strong>eels</strong> today.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            It's a real zoo around these parts.&nbsp;<span>😂<br>

            On Monday I spent the day at UVA meeting with my laryngologist, a speech and language pathologist, and my
            maxillofacial surgeon (jaw/face guy).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The theme of the day was: everything looks great! Also everything takes forever to heal so just be
            patient.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Dr. M<br>
            My vocal cords are functioning well. Vibrating properly, symmetrical, etc. They are still very swollen and I
            have a granuloma (little swollen nubbon) + possible dysfunction of the muscles that control my vocal cords.
            Fortunately all of that will hopefully improve on its own over the next several months. Plus, if it doesn't,
            there are procedures to address almost all those things. I GOT MY TRACH OUT!!! It'll take about a week for
            my hole to heal up, but even now it's SO NICE to not have that damn tube in my throat!<br>
            <br>
            SLP<br>
            My voice is already pretty strong. I'll start therapy next week. Might not see results for a while since
            there's still a good deal of physiological healing to do, but it won't hurt me to start speech before
            everything is "back to normal."&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Dr. C<br>
            My jaw is in a good position. My teeth have good occlusion (closure/coming together). It's unlikely that
            I'll need further surgeries down the road to address jaw/bite issues. Scars are healing well. Hopefully my
            body will be able to expel some of the remaining gravel dust from my face over the next 6 months. Given how
            deep it is, though, there's a good chance my body won't be very successful and I will remain with my mildly
            Hitler-stache-esque scarring under my nose. Not cool. Fortunately, after 6 months I can do more scar
            revision!<br>
            <br>
            Monday was a great day! I honestly had fun. I have great physicians who are fun to joke around with and are
            very gracious in answering my many, many questions.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            After riding the high of good news and fun times all around, I returned home Monday evening. Eating supper,
            I said to Anna: "Oh wait...I still hate this" (referring to eating) "Everything sucks!"&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Most recent frustrations: helmets and dental stuff<br>
            <br>
            Dr. C wants me to wear a full face bicycle helmet for the next 18 months. From what I've heard, they are
            hella hot. They are also hella expensive and in short supply. After much frustrated deliberation and a tiny
            gasp of horror at my purchase total, I bought one today! Katie put it well when she said: Way to take the
            hit with your wallet and not your face.&nbsp;<span class="mce-emoticon">😋</span>&nbsp;Love that
            girl.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            More delays with dental stuff. Scheduling is a.... and insurance stuff is likely going to be more
            complicated than I thought. WILL I EVER HAVE TEETH AGAIN?! On the bright side, since I wear a mask in all
            public spaces, if the people around me don't catch my lisp they probably won't know I'm a toothless dweeb.
            :)<br>
            <br>
            I am currently wavering between two mottos:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All will be well. And all will be well. All manner of things will
                be well.</span> (Thanks, Julian of Norwich.)&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Or, my alternative interpretation:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything is shit. And everything is shit. All manner of things
                will be shit.</span>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            I think both are equally and simultaneously accurate.

            <p>Wow! It's been over a month since I last updated you all. I am not going to attempt to summarize
                everything, but instead share the snippets of my life that come to mind or are more pertinent.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                - Hurray for (positive) energy. There were a couple weeks when I felt grumpy, angsty, sad, and/or
                unmotivated most of the time. I felt like a drain on the people around me. I didn't want to do anything,
                but also didn't want to do nothing. How come everyone else seems to be fine?! COVID is THE WORST! Why
                isn't everyone else insufferably miserable like me?!<br>
                Not sure what changed, but last week I suddenly got a burst of energy. I took on a bunch of projects,
                signed up for some online art classes from SPAIN, and felt much more like the oddly enthusiastic self
                that I usually am. Hurray for feeling actual joy! Hoping to ride this wave as long as
                possible.&nbsp;😊&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                - Boo, helmets! I purchased a super expensive helmet that was supposed to fit me, but it didn't. So I
                returned it, bought a different helmet from a different company that was also supposed to fit...but it
                didn't.&nbsp;😠&nbsp;Currently, I have a helmet on loan from a friend's 7-year-old son that mostly fits
                me. Yes, that's right, my head is the size of a 7-year-old.&nbsp;😩&nbsp; But even this one doesn't fit
                quite right. Can someone tell helmet companies to make a differently shaped mold or something?! I WANT
                TO RIDE MY BIKE! (And I can't until I get a dern helmet that fits.) So now I continue my search for a
                helmet...hopefully one that has a rear adjustment ratchet thing (rare find in full-face helmets) and
                doesn't cost $5,000.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                - School! Today was my first day of school. We basically know nothing about what "school" will look
                like, but I'm not stressed out by that. If my time as an ESL teacher has taught me anything, it is
                adaptability. I am good at what I do and I trust that I'll do some good stuff for kids. Will I likely
                work way more hours than I'm supposed to and feel a constant wish to multiply myself? Probably. But
                what's new?
            </p>
            <p>- Census Bureau. I also started work for the Census Bureau this week. Not excited to slog through 14
                hours of online training this weekend. But I am excited to be an enumerator (person that knocks on
                people's doors who haven't filled out the census yet.)</p>
            <p>- On top of those jobs I'm also (supposed to be) studying for the proficiency exam to hopefully
                participate in medical interpreter training this fall. I have certainly not met my goal of 25 min/day of
                studying. 😐</p>
            <p>- Teeth....but not really. Last Friday I got my "flipper," which is basically a retainer with fake teeth
                on it. It's kind of useless - largely for aesthetic purposes + helps me make certain letter sounds in a
                more normal way. But I take it out whenever I eat. It looks good, I guess, but mostly reminds me that
                things are not the way they were. My mouth is still full of scar tissue and doesn't move or look right.
                Things will get better.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                UVA is doing a fancy process to determine where my implants should be placed, which requires
                collaboration with a third-party lab, which is proving to take for-e-ver. I'm hoping I can get implants
                sometime in the next month. 🤞 Then I'll get to wait another 4-6 months before they put crowns on (the
                tooth-looking part). Woo.
            </p>
            <p>- No more blowhole! After my trach tube was removed, it took just over two weeks for my fistula (have fun
                with those Google results) healed up. Toward the end, if I breathed through it, it made funy farting
                noises. Haha! I'm glad to be blowhole-free and back to the normal number of breathing orifices. Now I
                just have a scar that looks like a strange neck belly button. 😋<br>
                <br>
                - Remaining annoyances, aside from my lack of teeth: voice, scar tissue, achey jaw. I'm doing voice
                therapy in hopes of improving my range, ease and volume, and the general sound of voice. I continue to
                massage my many scars and scar blobs in attempts to turn haystacks of garbled, gnarly, hypersensitive
                tissue into neat & organized, supple and stretchy normal tissue. I was supposed to go to PT this week
                (FINALLY), but there was a mix-up with my referral so my appointment had to be rescheduled. Whenever
                that happens, I'm hoping PT can help with the achey-ness and somewhat limited range of motion in my jaw,
                as well as addressing some random secondary effects that have cropped up, like pain in my fingers (what?
                Who decides these things?).&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                - O-H-I-O. I got to visit with my parents last weekend! We met in Ohio. They stayed at an Airbnb and
                Ethan and I camped in the yard. It was weird having to maintain distance and wear masks and whatnot, but
                was great to be able to be together. We went on several hikes and ate lots of ice cream. Love me some
                family time!<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for all the continued love and support. Y'all da best.

            <p>Y'all.....I spent ONE HOUR AND FORTY-EIGHT MINUTES on the phone with a representative from my insurance
                company on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just when I think myself pretty adept at navigating the medical and medical insurance worlds, [Unnamed
                Insurance Company] throws me a new bulls*&amp;% thing to figure out. Which inevitably requires hours of
                my time. And, of course, tests my ability to direct my anger and exasperation at the culprit
                (capitalism?) vs the usually-very-helpful-and-patient employee I'm on the phone with.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I am approximately 2% excited about the time I'll be spending filing my own dang dental-turned-medical
                claims in the next year...Unless my very effective strategy - the thankey-pushy-thankey sandwich - can
                strike gold once more and get my provider to do it (which I'm pretty dern sure they're <em>supposed
                    to</em>). 🤞</p>
            <p>Despite how infuriating dealing with insurance can be, I'm also eternally grateful for it. If not for my
                employer-provided insurance, I'd be buried in over $300,000 of medical bills! 😱 I am so thankful for
                the highly specialized care I received and continue to receive. I'm also aghast at the financial cost of
                that care, but more so the fact that the cost of care serves as such a barrier for so many. So many
                people in our great country do not have access to or cannot afford quality preventive care and necessary
                treatment, by no fault of their own! If you learn anything from my accident I hope it is NOT how
                "strong" I am, nor how amazing the human body is, but rather how important healthcare reform is. We can
                do better!</p>
            <p>Speaking of "do better"...the surgical guide for my implants is...still...not...done. Honestly it kind of
                feels like by now I could have gone to dental school or third-party-laboratory school and created the
                guide myself. The dental clinic I go to has now switched to using a different lab, supposedly with a
                fabulous reputation and a 5-business-day turnaround for surgical guides. Five business days should have
                been today. 🤨🧐🤥 If my surgical guide doesn't arrive next week I'm apt to flip a table. Need I remind
                you that even after this ding dang guide arrives - and I hopefully get my implants the following week -
                I still have to wait SIX MONTHS for my crowns? Let's say I magically get my implants this Friday and get
                my crowns exactly 6 months from then, on March 18th. I will have been without my front teeth for ten
                friggin months! Ugh.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Anywho. Here's some random-ish happies and crappies:</p>
            <p>- Happy: In the last month, the highest note my voice can produce has increased by a whole octave!</p>
            <p>- Happy: I have an in-person appt with my laryngologist on Monday! Not only do I totally love Dr. M, I'm
                also excited to get scoped and see cool images of my insides. 🤓 And excited to see what he has to say
                about my prognosis. Hopefully all good things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Crappy: scar tissue freaking suuuuuuuuuucks. So annoying. And painful. A real question that I think
                about: Will I ever be able to properly kiss someone again? Will it ever be enjoyable again?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Happy: DANCE. (Many of you have already listened to me gush for <em>hours</em> about how
                life-alteringly awesome Brazilian Zouk is, so I guess I'll refrain from typing up a treatise here. In
                the case of anyone who has&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>sat through such gushing sessions and is
                curious....girl, I will hook you up with all the videos! And talk your ear off.) Over the last four
                weeks I took an online Zouk class and it was SO GREAT. It feels so good to move my body to Zouky
                rhythms. Yum!</p>
            <p>- Crappy: Time. Like I complained to my housemates this evening: "Where does the time go? Why don't I
                have time to make time for the time? Time! Time." It is hard to make time for PT and voice exercises and
                scar massage amid all the other things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Happy: loud music played on my bluetooth speaker while riding my bike. (Special thanks to the folks
                that sent me $ to make that experience happen once more!)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>**Evidently I can no longer add captions to photos so:</p>
            <p>Pre-Crash teeth. Damn I took that smile for granted! Finally remembered to take a picture of me with my
                flipper. (Ok, not a good quality photo...) I'm open to your thoughts on how close they got to my real
                teeth. I think the flipper teeth are a little short. What says the crowd?</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>Today I got my canine built up with a filling! <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y9CjQ54TKhDk6p12A"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Here's a video</a> (no gore - just beautiful
                pearly whites). Have I mentioned before how I despise novacaine, numbness, narcotics, loopiness, drugs
                in general? I once had a filling done without novocaine and it was the most delightful dental experience
                I've had, so opted for that again and my dentist agreed. Aside from a couple moderate <em>zings</em>, it
                was easy breezy.</p>
            <p>What was actually done today? During my accident I lost four whole teeth, but also broke off a chunk of
                my left canine. Today, my dentist roughed up the remaining tooth, did a little drilling, then used this
                fancy polimer stuff to basically sculpt a (partial) tooth onto my broken one. Fascinating! I'm also
                pretty impressed with how similar it looks and feels. Do they teach sculpture in dental school? 😄&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>Belated update: I GOT MY IMPLANTS! 😍🤗😍</p>
            <p>Back in October my surgical guide FI-NA-LLY arrived, so on the 27th I drove to UVA to get my implants and
                bone grafting done. It took a little over two hours. They shot me up with a whole lotta numbing
                medication - so much so that my eyelids were numb and <a
                    href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SbaFtihzntKcGLEU9" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I couldn't move my face until the next day</a>. Otherwise,
                though, I got to be awake and alert the whole time (which is how I prefer it). I wore my "girl power"
                socks, got comfy in my house slippers, and listened to my chillest Spotify playlist with my earbuds as
                multiple people operated on me. Again,&nbsp;<em>fascinating!</em> The basic process was (maybe skip this
                if you're faint of heart):</p>
            <p>-cut open gums</p>
            <p>- slice/pull gums away from upper jaw bone&nbsp; -- This part was definitely the grossest. I couldn't
                feel anything, but I could <em>hear&nbsp;</em>what they were doing and that was...unsettling.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- hold surgical guide in place -- turns out the surgical guide was basically a little retainer with holes
                in it that showed them where to drill, a lot like <a
                    href="https://www.group4dentallab.com/tpn/c/C801/img/surgical-guide-3.jpg" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a></p>
            <p>- drill holes into Aliese's head! 😨 -- Haha!</p>
            <p>- bathroom break! -- There was some downtime, so I went and used the bathroom. :)</p>
            <p>- use the cutest little ratchet wrench you'll ever see to screw some screws into said holes -- sounds
                terrible but was actually amusing. Such a cute wittle rench! Such cute wittle rench noises! If you want
                gross pictures that show the little screws in my jaw, hit me up. You know I took them! 😏</p>
            <p>- pack some bone dust on top of my jaw bone</p>
            <p>- surround bone dust with a fancy membrane to hold it into place</p>
            <p>- attempt to stretch Aliese's gums back in place.....then "score" her gums A LOT to loosen them up and
                stretch them further -- again, gross</p>
            <p>- sew everything up - <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/p81vb9wz9X7Yrqg49" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Here's a video I took once I was all sewn up.</a> (Don't watch it
                if you're grossed out by blood and stuff.)</p>
            <p>All in all, it was pretty gnarly, very interesting, and not too bad. Afterwards, my face swelled up and I
                got a black eye and I returned to not liking food for a while. That sucked. I "went to work" the next
                day but spent all my non-meeting time laying on the couch with ice on my face. I also taught students
                the day after that, which was funny. My students took it in stride.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Since implant surgery I haven't been able to wear my flipper because of (a) swelling and (b) my gum area
                is thicker from the grafting. So by now both my students and everyone else in my life are used to
                toothless Aliese. Part of me thinks,&nbsp;<em>Do I really need these front teeth</em>? Lolz. Only
                somewhat. Hard to teach /f/ and /v/ sounds without them. Unfortunately, despite several adjustments
                today, my flipper still doesn't fit. We're going to try again in January. :P Also today, they cleaned
                off the grayish pirate stains from the post-implant mouthwash I had to use. I like pirates but I prefer
                not looking like one. Yay!</p>
            <p>More updates to come, about voice stuff and scar stuff and maybe some other things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Much love!</p>

            <p>Tomorrow morning I'm having another scar revision surgery.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I already had one scar revision surgery done this summer. At that time, despite there being plenty of
                debri in my face, there were not sizeable enough gravel bits to pluck them out individually. Instead,
                Dr. C and his resident removed whole (little) swaths of scar tissue that had gravel embedded in it. They
                also did some derm abrasion (sanding down my skin) in hopes that some little nuggets would find their
                way to the surface and pop out of my face on their own. No such luck. So, while things look better than
                they did, I still have a gravel tattoo/scar that is reminiscent of Hitler's mustache. Plus the stuff on
                my eye that looks kinda like Scar (the wicked uncle in Lion King). <a
                    href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4uKfZ4pksz6VdtY8A" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Photo evidence</a>. Also, in high school I was consistently cast
                as the villain in drama performances......is this all some sort of sign? 🤔</p>
            <p>Dr. C has since moved away so now I'm under the care of Dr. P. Dr P says it is not a good idea to use the
                swath-removing strategy again because it will leave indentations in my face. Yay. Instead, the plan is
                to make an incision and go exploring in hopes of finding a Great Majestic Gravel Bit in its natural
                habitat. (<a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/S6SnhToce2ogLoP5Ts/giphy.gif" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Behold!</a>) Unfortunately, imho if there weren't chunks big
                enough this summer I highly doubt they've congregated together since then. Thus there's a decent chance
                they cut me open, decide they can't really do anything, and sew me back up. But I want to do it anyway,
                just in case...even if it does mean waking up at 4:25am. 😵</p>
            <p>So! If you read this before 8:00am ish on Tuesday, consider sending up some prayers or positive gravel
                vibes that they find some big ol' rocks. Big money, big money! (Never thought I'd be praying to find
                rocks in my face...)</p>

            <p>This is an abridged version of an update I started writing in early December. Despite being abridged, it
                is still&nbsp;<em>extremely&nbsp;</em>long. Remember that you are under no obligation to read it! But if
                it sounds fun to be mildly&nbsp; confused by an overwhelming amount of incomplete information, the party
                has arrived.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Two of the injuries I suffered during The Crash were fracturing my laryngeal cartilage and tearing my
                left vocal cord. Dr. M expertly reconstructed my cartilage and stitched up my vocal cord, but even now a
                few physiological issues remained:</p>
            <p>1. Swelling: in both vocal cords</p>
            <p>2. Scar band: I have a teeny, tiny band of scar tissue where they stitched my left vocal cord</p>
            <p>3. Asymmetry: while my right vocal cord undulates beautifully, my left one kind of flaps around like a
                baby bird that hasn't mastered flying. Unless I'm screaming. Then it does pretty well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4. Gap: my vocal cords don't make a complete seal at the back/at the end of their wave</p>
            <p>These issues, possibly in combination with other things, have resulted in several complaints from me -
                some now resolved, others remaining.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Fatigue: my voice wears out MUCH faster than it used to</p>
            <p>- Inability to be loud - this has improved quite a bit, but I'm no longer the loudest person I know.
                Sad.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Voice cracks: For a while, any time I used the upper half of my range, I sounded like a teenager in the
                throes of puberty. When this first started happening, I found it very entertaining, while also
                distressing if it were to be a thing that lasted. Fortunately, this, too has mostly resolved.</p>
            <p>- Smoker voice: The general sound of my voice is pretty gravelly and "smoker sounding." Again, this has
                improved, but definitely not 100% better.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Inability to produce high pitches. This is the most persistent issue, as well as the one that I find
                most upsetting. I'm no Ariana Grande (she's the young people's Mariah Carey), but I would estimate that
                I've lost the top third of my vocal range. This interferes with singing, cheering, and all my silly
                voices on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So what have we done about all this? Lots of voice therapy and a couple of steroid injections.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I've met with a fantastic voice therapist every couple weeks since August or September. In that time
                we've covered:</p>
            <p>- resonance (making my voice resonate in a higher and more forward region...don't ask me to explain this
                because I still don't really understand it and don't mind that we've moved on)</p>
            <p>- accessing higher pitches - by practicing vocal glides</p>
            <p>- vocal stamina and recuperating after fatigue - practice holding notes for as long as possible + what we
                call "straw bubble". Straw bubble is my fave exercise cuz it's easy. Basically, I hum through a straw
                into water. That creates "back pressure", which helps me access higher pitches with less vocal strain
                and is also a great exercise for recovering from vocal strain.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- preventing fatigue/enabling loudness through twang - Vocal twang is NOT the same as a southern drawl.
                Instead, vocal twang is produced by narrowing the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryepiglottic_fold#/media/File:Slide16sss.JPG" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">aryepiglottic sphincter</a> (called the aryepiglottic folds in
                that diagram). In layperson terms: I constrict my throat, but <em>above</em> my vocal cords. It makes a
                very "bright" - or harsh - tone, which makes me sound significantly louder without me straining my
                voice. Think of a baby crying. That sound is twangalicious. Alternative example: <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4pwTD24r4" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Janice, from Friends, is the Queen of Twang</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- getting my thyroid cartilage unstuck - by saying "ping" and "bing" in a high pitch or by whimpering</p>
            <p>- eliminating nasality - by practicing annoying exercises to keep my velum in a higher position. Think of
                what you sound like when you have a cold. That's the epitome of non-nasal.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- eliminating twang - LOL. First I learned how to use it to be loud without strain. Then, as I continued
                to be dissatisfied with my voice, we toyed around with different things that might be bothering me. In
                that process, I learned how to get rid twang entirely. It makes me sound very late night radio
                announcer-ey. Turns out, not the source of my dissatisfaction, but I'll keep this skill in my arsenal in
                case I need to seduce someone anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There was a period where I made huge gains. Almost a whole octave of range in about a month. Then there
                was a plateau, largely as expected. During that time, Dr. M and I decided to try a steroid injection,
                with the hope being that it would soften the scar band and reduce swelling. That procedure is my least
                favorite that I've endured. It is&nbsp;<em>acutely</em> miserable for about an hour and a half. After
                that, not as bad. Here's a summary:</p>
            <p>Numb my nose with lidocaine. Huff more lidocaine to numb my throat. Numb my mouth with something-caine,
                which tastes like cotton candy from hell. Resident puts scope up my nose and down my throat. Dr. M holds
                my tongue down and snakes a tiny needle down my throat. I say "eee" as long as I can while he injects my
                vocal cords with lidocaine then with dexamethasone. For the next hour+ I feel like I'm low-key drowning
                in soup made of fire. Also, I produce drool like a fountain, can't feel myself swallowing (or breathing,
                for that matter), and must attempt to not cough. Also I'm not allowed to produce sound for 24 hours.
                Good thing I'm great with a clipboard.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Injection # 1 was back on October 16. My follow-up showed that the scar band had, indeed, softened, but
                was still inhibiting proper function of the cord somewhat. I also gained about a note and a half of
                vocal range, which, at that point, was sizeable. Subsequently, I signed myself up for another injection.
                Does that make me masochist?</p>
            <p>If you've read this far: congrats! I find medical stuff fascinating and honestly had to reign myself in
                from giving even more detail. You might think that with all this information, we (my doctors and I) know
                exactly what's going on and how to fix it. Joke's on you! There's actually a lot of unknowns. Sigh. To
                address other confusing symptoms that may or may not be contributing to my vocal woes, I've also been on
                two nasal sprays and two antacids.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One thing we&nbsp;<em>do</em> know is that in order to produce high pitches, one must achieve the
                following trifecta:</p>
            <p>- raise&nbsp; your larynx</p>
            <p>- tilt your thyroid cartilage, using your cricothyroid muscle(s?), which is (are?) controlled by the
                superior laryngeal nerve</p>
            <p>- stretch your vocal folds very long and thin</p>
            <p>When I first started writing this update, we were relatively sure that I was, indeed able to do the first
                two things and that the problem was mainly with the last. We thought that my inability to get vocally
                high was mostly because swelling and scarring were preventing my vocal cords from stretching out
                properly. Thus the nasal sprays, antacids, steroids, and therapy. We threw a lot of tools at the problem
                and hoped that something would fix it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Have things gotten better? Absolutely! Here's <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8dD7FsCaDBQGFMCRA"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">me in June</a> (still had my jaws wired shut at
                the time and hadn't figured out how to say Rs yet, lolz). Here's <a

                Certainly a big difference in how my speaking voice sounds. Also a big difference in my range (not
                something you can really tell from those videos). Lest we forget, though, <a
                    href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XYypTkZoYHmnQ3Er9" target="_blank"

                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> are the sorts of things my voice used to be able to do.
                Being realistic, I was never a huge fan of how my voice sounded pre-Crash, but I dearly miss all the
                vocal flexibility I had (<em>and regularly employed</em>) back then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So...what's next? What happened with that second steroid injection? And how about my scar revision
                surgery? Did they find any rocks?!</p>

            <p>What follows is a non-exhaustive list of things I'm sick of. If you don't like swear words then don't
                read this post.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I'm tired of having such big emotions. I have always been a person that feels things deeply. Lately it
                has felt more and more burdensome and frustrating, or embarrassing or confusing. How is it that 8 months
                after The Crash, I have such intense feelings of loss, sadness, and anger? Sometimes, I'm fine.
                Certainly, I experience joy. Sometimes, I really am doing quite well. Much of the time, though, I have
                these expansive, intense feelings, roiling just below the surface. Sometimes I can keep the lid on them.
                Frequently, little leaks spring up when I don't want them to. Someone asks me how I'm doing in too
                sincere of a tone. --&gt; Tears. I get toothpaste on my face but don't realize it right away. --&gt;
                Sudden bout of rage that I can't still can't feel my fucking lip. Someone posts a video of themselves
                dancing with a practice partner. --&gt; Overwhelming hatred (+jealousy). Dr. M acknowledges that it's ok
                to take a break. --&gt; Snot. Angry at myself for not doing my PT exercises --&gt; raging fire of
                bitterness over all the myriad tasks I'm supposed to do to take care of my damn body.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I started taking a class this past week, all about tools for building resiliency. The class is centered
                around the practice of <a href="https://www.tappingsolutionfoundation.org/howdoesitwork/"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tapping/EFT</a>, which I had never done before.
                After some set-up, &nbsp;we went through one round and I guess that was enough to peel back my layer of
                control and unleash the wells of emotion in me. I sat there doing everything I could to not start
                bawling in front of a bunch of strangers over Zoom. And what the fuck? My emotions are not a well; they
                are a fucking OCEAN. A past counselor advised that I let myself feel the feels, rather than fighting
                them. -- Good life practice. Highly recommend. -- But also, these days something uncaps The Feels and I
                try to be all emotionally in touch and healthy and shit, setting up a seat like <a
                    href="https://media.giphy.com/media/cS83sLRzgVOeY/giphy.gif" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this kid</a> to accept my emotions as they are and instead get
                completely smacked in the face and swept away. Instead of some pretty - or ugly - wave washing over me I
                end up drowning in it. With emotions that big and consuming and intense, it takes a <em>really long
                    time</em> to tap/yoga/run/journal/dance them away. Processing all that is time-consuming and
                exhausting. I, for one, and tired of it. Also, sometimes I don't have <em>time&nbsp;</em>(or energy) to
                *process* everything so I just stuff it down (again) knowing&nbsp; it'll sure as heck be there later to
                deal with then.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Sometimes it helps to talk about it. But God am I sick of talking about it. That's not true. Sometimes I
                could talk about it for hours. And I do. I talk about it with Anna and Andrea and Laura and Gracie and
                Polly and Mom <em>all the time</em>. And other people, too. Honestly pretty much everyone, in different
                degrees of vulnerability and duration. But even with so many outlets I'm still often holding my tongue.
                Tired of complaining ALL THE TIME. Tired of only ever talking about myself. Tired of always being the
                messed-up one.&nbsp; Tired of being an emotional leech, slowly draining everyone around me of their
                emotional reserves. I don't want to be this way.</p>
            <p>Other times I <em>am</em> sick of talking about it. I don't want to process anymore. I don't want to feel
                such big feelings. I don't want to spend time on them. I want to live my God damn life. I want to answer
                my emails and vacuum the kitchen floor and read my book and do the things that normal people who aren't
                perpetually slaves to their emotions do.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For a while, particularly this summer, I think I did a really great job of letting myself feel whatever I
                felt, talking about it when I needed to, and letting it go. But at a certain point I stopped feeling
                like it was ok to be grumpy or ok to cry to my housemates or whatever else. "It's been 4 months (or 6
                months or 8 months)!" said a voice in my head. "Time to be done grieving." Time to get over it, move on.
                Time to be better. Certainly I and probably you have seen the memes about how grief isn't what our
                society thinks it is - how grief doesn't go away; it just shrinks. Or how grief doesn't even shrink, it
                actually fills in all the crevices of your life. Or how grief never goes away - you just learn to live
                with it. Well that's nice. Thanks for the affirming meme. But society hasn't caught up so it still feels
                shitty to be crying about something that happened what feels like a long-ass time ago. And even if
                everyone in the world was all woke about grief, it wouldn't make it suck any less to be the one
                grieving. Not to mention the fact that everyone in the whole freaking world is also grieving their own
                shit right now, so what makes me so special?</p>
            <p>On that note: why isn't everyone else falling apart? Why am I the only one unwillingly bursting into
                tears in front of caring doctors, or suddenly falling silent and dead-faced around well-meaning people
                who makes infuriating comments, or choking up over THE SMALLEST FUCKING THINGS? Why doesn't anyone else
                seem to be treading water in an endless sea of angst and upset? How come it's just me? (Of course it's
                not just me, but I sure don't <em>witness</em> very many other people falling apart.)</p>
            <p>I am tired of having to spend so much fucking time taking care of myself (emotionally, physically, and
                mentally).</p>
            <p>I'm tired of having to go through an hour long bedtime routine in order for my brain to SHUT THE FUCK UP
                and go to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I'm tired of literally earning less money because if I worked more I wouldn't have time for all the
                self-care shit and I'd be a mess.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I am SOOOOOOO tired of people not believing that I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT whether in regards to my
                body or my pain tolerance or my freaking medical bills and how to file them correctly. OH MY GOSH I'VE
                LITERALLY CALLED YOUR DEPARTMENT NINE TIMES AND EXPLAINED THIS PROBLEM TO YOU IN DETAIL EVERY TIME AND
                EVEN HAD MY INSURANCE COMPANY CALL YOU AND SOMEHOW THREE MONTHS LATER YOU STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THE
                PROBLEM. Go ahead and send that email, Linda. I'm sure department X will take care of it. JUST KIDDING!
                I ALREADY TALKED TO DEPARTMENT X, LINDA. THEY SENT ME TO YOU! At this point, I probably could have just
                gotten a second job and paid the bill with my extra wages if I didn't have to deal with all YOUR
                BULLSHIT, Linda (and a thousand other people).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I am tired of trying really hard to not get my hopes up, to maintain low expectations, while being
                incapable of actually letting go of that hope because it's what keep me from crying&nbsp;<em>all</em>
                the time. And I'm tired of my hopes being consistently disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello! I started writing a more detailed post over a month ago. Instead, here's the quick and dirty:</p>
            <p>- January sucked because I got bad news about basically everything + my food aversions came back +
                clinical depression...woohoo!</p>
            <p>- Hurray for therapy</p>
            <p>- OMG HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE STILL
                UNRESOLVED?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????????? Actually, I did end up filing my claims myself, despite it being my
                provider's legal obligation to do so (I&nbsp;<em>think</em>). Fingers crossed my insurance company
                accepts my 20 pages of documents and approves my claims without batting an eye. Ha!</p>
            <p>- Tomorrow I go to the dental clinic for them to "uncover" my implants (aka cut my gums open again) and
                install the healing abutments, which I believe are basically little rods that screw into my implants but
                stick out above my gumline for my gums to heal around. A month later I'll return for impressions to be
                taken to make my crowns (the teeth part). Good news: my orthodontist had molds of my teeth from high
                school that can be used to help make my fake teeth look more like my real teeth. Bad news: I don't want
                fake teeth. I want my teeth back. And I will never ever get them back. Guh.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- As Tuesday marks 11 months, it is very unlikely that I will see any more vocal healing. There are a few
                procedures we could try but none of them are designed for a case like me and all of them carry a risk of
                making things worse. I've come to largely accept my new speaking voice but I still regularly get angry
                when trying to sing or do other things I used to be able to do much better.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I am trying to do better at recognizing that what I've experienced classifies as "trauma," and that
                that trauma is ongoing as I continue to recover far longer than when I anticipated. I often complain
                that I "just want to be done." I just want things back how they were. Or I just want to be done
                processing, done healing, done grieving, done with procedures, done with therapy. *I want to be free.*
                Not there yet.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I feel far less emotionally turbulent and drained than when I wrote my last update. That makes me
                happy. Hurray for progress! I also am feeling more hopeful about life in general as more and more people
                in my life are able to get vaccinated. That allowed me to travel with Ethan to visit Mom, Dad, and
                Grandma Gingerich in Iowa last week, which was so SO lovely.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I rode my bike 90 miles in the month of March! I also went on several solo hikes and listened to a lot
                of great audiobooks. My most recent read, which I highly recommend, is&nbsp;<a

            <p>I have a date! (If all goes according to plan) on June 14th I will return to UVA to get my

                    href="https://emojikeyboard.org/copy/Crown_Emoji_%F0%9F%91%91" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">👑</a>&nbsp;😃 &nbsp;A month ago, I would have said that I was
                largely dreading the day I get my crowns. Of course I understand logically that my teeth will not be
                growing back. Even so, I expected the finality of the crowns - the last step in regards to my teeth - to
                be another reminder that I don't get to ever have MY teeth back. I also didn't anticipate liking them. I
                cried when I got my flipper back in August. Just one more new/different/inferior-than-before thing to
                get used to. While I'm still trying to keep my expectations low and leave space to grieve, right now I'm
                actually excited about getting my crowns. From October through March or so, I didn't wear my flipper
                because it no longer fit. I got very used to life with no front teeth. My students got used to seeing me
                without my teeth (over Google Meet, when I was teaching virtually). While it may seem odd, I often had
                the feeling that I didn't really need or want crowns. In April, I got a new flipper. Even though it's
                useless for eating, I was reminded how nice it is to be able to say Vs and Fs and THs properly. That
                reminder, along with other things, has me feeling more optimistic about my reaction to getting crowns.
                Also, if nothing else, I think it will be a source of joy to feel "done" with at least one element of my
                recovery. Even as I say that, though, I also know that I will genuinely miss my visits to the dentist.
                Dr. M was the person who pulled my remaining (dangling) front tooth before I went to the OR. He saw me
                when things were gruesome. He was there when I was drugged up and unable to speak, using a clipboard to
                ask for Jack Johnson music while they sewed my face back together. I've shared bits of my emotional
                journey with him throughout the last year. He doesn't always "get it", but he also&nbsp;<em>does</em>
                get it because he's been with me through all of it. Consequently he knows things like the fact that I
                won't want sedatives for anything and I will want to take pictures of everything.<br>
                Part of my feeling like I don't want crowns is that a small part of me appreciates that anyone who sees
                me (without a mask) immediately knows that I've been through some <em>shit</em>. Not only does this
                carry some street credit, it makes me feel like even if I don't explain anything about trauma, people
                can imagine that I've had some rough days, and treat me accordingly. (Sidenote: while in some ways I
                like not having to explain my journey, I also usually love talking about it, love when people ask me
                questions about it, and could honestly share the minute details of my recovery for hours, given the
                chance.) Anyway, I'm going to cut off this rabbit trail and return to my original intent:<br>
                <br>
                As I shared last time, about a month ago I went in to get my implants "uncovered." It was grosser than I
                anticipated. Here's a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kbSbQ2kNcDjDtDDa7" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video clip</a> in which Dr. M is holding back the tissue so I can
                see the new healing abutment sticking out. Here's him <a

                little screw driver!&nbsp;😝&nbsp;And here's me with <a

                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a picture of the abutments</a> several days afterward.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Things healed well and yesterday I went in for a series of next steps. This included turning my
                broken-then-temporarily-repaired canine into <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2sdLSDsUMJczJaFt6"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a little peg</a>, giving me <a

                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">metal fangs</a> for about fifteen minutes, taking x-rays and
                multiple kinds of impressions, and choosing a shade for my crowns that matches the rest of my
                teeth.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                A couple other things:<br>
                <br>
                Eff insurance, man! 😡&nbsp;One claim got approved! The biggest ($$) claim got denied on a technicality
                that is not my fault and which I will be appealing. The third is still in limbo because of another
                technicality which is honestly more their fault than mine. More hours on the phone
                ahead.&nbsp;😩&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Tomorrow is the anniversary of The Crash! I had planned to write more about that this evening, but it's
                late and I want to get to bed so that I can be rested tomorrow. I'm going to hike <a

                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Old Rag</a>! Then I'll come home, eat food I did not make myself,
                take an epsom salt bath, and open a gift from my parents. Maybe I'll also take time to write some of the
                anniversary-related things I meant to share tonight. If not, let me end with a hearty THANK YOU. Thank
                you for all the ways that you have supported me over the last year! Collectively, you've sent food,
                money, cards, prayers; offered words of encouragement, allowed me space to rage and grieve; cared for
                the people who cared for me, and so many other wonderful things. Things would have sucked a lot more
                without your love and support.&nbsp;😅&nbsp;So thank you, thank you, and thank you some more for helping
                things not suck quite so bad!&nbsp;<br>

            <p>Having no front teeth has honestly provided fodder for much entertainment. At other times it's been
                annoying, embarrassing, frustrating, or demoralizing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I was supposed to get my crowns last week but&nbsp;<em>of course</em> there was a delay with the lab, so
                instead I get them tomorrow morning. I'm feeling kind of excited, sprinkled with trepidation. I am going
                in with the expectation that I'm probably going to hate them at first, and hate having to get used to
                yet another new thing, and probably going to cry from the wave of mixed emotions that's likely to hit me
                after having waited for 13 months for this day. I'm also still hoping that I'm pleasantly
                surprised.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Below are a few photos I took this evening as a keepsake. I know that part of me will miss not having
                front teeth, regardless of how strange that seems. Grief is weird.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another quick update: a while ago I had another check-in with my laryngologist. He confirmed that my
                vocal cords are still chubby/swollen AF, and a little misshapen. We talked about options and I was
                pleasantly surprised that some of the things he had mentioned back in January actually carried less risk
                than what I originally perceived. As such, I've been using a steroid inhaler for a while and tomorrow
                (Monday) I'll be getting my vocal cords blasted with a laser. 🤩👩‍🎤 The goal is to reduce some of the
                bulk and correct some of the curvature (which should, instead, be nice and straight). Because I have
                relatively excellent vocal function (compared to a year ago as well as compared to other patients
                treated with the same/similar procedure), Dr. M is going to be very conservative with his laser
                blasting, so as to not cause additional scarring (which would make things worse). Thus the biggest risk,
                according to him, is that he doesn't do&nbsp;<em>enough</em> blasting and I don't actually get any
                benefit (but still have to pay buku bucks). That's a risk I'm willing to take. Also I'm not allowed to
                phonate (speak or make noise of any kind) for three days. Then minimal phonation for another three+.
                Then eventually return to normal voice usage. Ha! I've been affectionately referring to the upcoming
                week as my "week of silence." As I'm quite used to communicating via paper/pencil at this point, I'm not
                worried about it. I know the procedure itself will probably suck. I opted to do it in clinic with just
                local numbing instead of general anesthesia. Dr. M agreed because I've been such a "rock star" with the
                steroid injections and he believes I'll be able to hold still enough for him to have the level of
                accuracy he needs without knocking me out. I anticipate that the procedure will be similar to my steroid
                injections - aka it'll feel like I'm drowning in fire for a while, and then I'll just feel like I have a
                bad head cold til the next day. Aside from the physical misery, I'm kind of looking forward to the
                forced silence. Something different to mix things up!</p>
            <p>Anyway. It's late and I need to go to bed such that I can be my optimal self for crowns and counseling
                and lasers tomorrow! Nighty night!</p>

            <p>I got my crowns this morning! Sort of. The bridge seats correctly. I will also have a crown on my left
                canine. Unfortunately that one wasn't quite right - too much space between it and the bridge, if I'm
                remembering correctly - so Dr. M has to send it back to the lab for adjustment. For now, he put my
                temporary crown back on. That means I have to wait another week or so til the lab fixes my permanent
                crown, then return to UVA to have it put on. Despite how picky Dr. M was about getting the shade right,
                looking at the bridge in my mouth, it's not a perfect match. Likely a result of my other teeth
                regressing a bit after I whitened them. I'm going to use a few more white strips to see if I can
                brighten my other teeth to match the bridge. If that doesn't work, Dr. M said that the bridge can also
                be sent back to the lab to make it a smidge duller/yellower to match my other teeth. I'm pleased with
                how similar to my real teeth the crowns look. Honestly better than I expected. I do not like that I have
                a slight lisp when I say Ss. I've talked to two people in person plus Mom & Dad over the phone. None of
                them noticed or could hear the lisp when I pointed it out. To me, though, my Ss sound too airy. Akin to
                the sound of blowing air through a straw, or blowing across the top of a jug. Maybe I got used to the
                overly sharp Ss from my flipper. While wearing my flipper, my Ss kind of whistle. I don't like the
                whistle, either. It could be that my Ss sounded like this before The Crash, with my own teeth. I don't
                think so, though. It was comforting that Dr. M confirmed lispy Ss are a real thing. When dealing with
                implants, the goal is to have good occlusion (teeth meeting/touching your other teeth) while minimizing
                the force that the crowns (and thus the implants themselves) will receive when biting and chewing.
                "Light" occlusion is ideal. In order to achieve "light" occlusion, you don't want the crowns to be too
                long, hit the other teeth too hard, be too bulky, etc. In striving for that, it can mean that more air
                sneaks in around the teeth, creating a more airey, wooshy, soft, lispy sound. Good news: we can send the
                bridge to the lab and have them add more porcelain to hopefully eliminate the lisp. Since I have to go
                back for the permanent canine crown anyway, we're going to wait a week, see if my tongue adjusts/how
                much the sound bothers me, then&nbsp; proceed from there. Bad news: more unknowns, more possible wait
                time. More bad news: Dr. M's residency ends next week. He's going on a well-earned vacation and
                transitioning to a local private practice. I'm excited for him, but very much sad to lose him from my
                care team and have a new dentist. I've interacted some with the other residents and they're great, too.
                But they aren't the person who's been with me the last 13 months, who met me in the OR and seen all the
                shit I've been through.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I am so tired of getting used to new things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I felt fine/happy-ish during my appointment. Definitely ugly cried in the car afterward.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Decided to eat a piece of pizza for lunch today. Mostly a disappointment. Kinda cool to be able to tear
                it off better, but not great. When I try to bite off a piece using my bridge and bottom teeth, my back
                teeth sometimes rind together weird. And if I just bite down normal, I have a pretty big overbite and
                things don't tear off well. Is this how it was like to eat pizza before? Or is biting inferior now? I
                don't know. I'm sure it will get better as I figure out how to use my new teeth better. Again, I'm tired
                of having to get used to new things.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't like how my scar tissue sticks out when I smile, or how it rubs on my bridge when I eat.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>Overall, I think I will eventually be quite pleased with the results. For now my feelings are mostly
                negative.&nbsp;Time to stuff my feelings down for a few minutes while I make some phone calls since I
                won't be able to make calls after my laser appointment. Then I'll come back to my feels and maybe eat
                some pie before heading to the ENT clinic for laser time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Attached are a few photos of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had a *moment* this evening. I was watching Sex Education.&nbsp; --It's a Netflix show that I HIGHLY
                recommend. Honestly, I think it should be required viewing for all adolescents and anyone who ever plans
                to have sex, be a friend or parent to someone who has sex, or is in any romantic or non-romantic
                relationship with another human. 😅😇 If you want an exhaustive list of reasons why I love the show, let
                me know.-- One of the characters, Isaac, is a young man with a spinal injury. He's charming, a bit of an
                a**hole, mischievous. And even though I've seen him on screen in many episodes, only this evening did I
                realize HE HAS A TRACH SCAR. I've never seen someone with a trach scar on TV before. Not that I've
                really been keeping track - I might not have even noticed it on someone prior to my accident. But I
                noticed it tonight. And it feels special. Particularly in the context of the very tender, loving,
                intimate scene in which I first noticed his scar. It's powerful to see someone with a neck bellybutton
                be loved and lusted after. I feel seen. I feel represented. I feel a little less weird.&nbsp; Thank you,
                Netflix. Thank you, Sex Education. Thank you, <a

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also, one of many overdue updates (wow! Has it really been three months since I last posted on here?!): I
                had another scar revision surgery scheduled for sometime in August, to work on untethering my trach scar
                and possibly work on the pen-mark-looking scar on my nose. After a good bit of deliberation, I cancelled
                that surgery. No, I do not like how my trach scar looks. And the tethering is annoying (it *tugs* when I
                swallow or make high-pitched noises). But untethering my trach scar would involve messing with the
                muscles in my neck and while my surgeon didn't portray that as a big deal, in my experience surgeons
                tend to underestimate how much they f*%$ you up. I did extensive physical therapy for my
                neck/jaw/shoulders/fingers starting almost exactly a year ago (at the time, in August). I didn't feel
                like I had the wherewithal, and certainly not the desire, to go through that again because of an
                optional surgery. So...no surgery. Instead, I keep my trach scar as is. I can operate on it at any point
                in the future if I want to. For now, I'll just live with this thing that I don't like, but sometimes
                feel proud of, and sometimes makes me feel ugly or embarrassed or weird, and sometimes forget
                about.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Attached are a few photos of me that show off my trach scar, as well as two of actor George Robinson, who
                portrays Isaac (stolen from his Instagram page).</p>

            <p>I had a second laser procedure done on September 20th. Recovery from that requires 4 days of complete
                silence, then a week and a half of minimal speaking, building up to moderate. At two weeks out I'm
                supposed to be able to use my voice more or less however I want without risk of damaging anything. My
                vocal cords will continue to heal over the course of about 6 weeks (including the two weeks of voice
                rest/conservation).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Last week my voice seemed to have gotten rougher all of a sudden. Anytime my intonation ventured above a
                very low baseline pitch, it turned into just breath with no real noise. Or sometimes it would crack and
                squeak. Long story short it turns out I have mild hemorrhaging on my right vocal cord. Not a huge deal.
                Should heal fine. The treatment? Silence. Again. And if I don't stay silent? Well, then it might turn
                into polyps or semi-permanent scar tissue, which would negate the positive effects of the procedure and
                set me back considerably, possibly forever. No big deal. So...silence it is.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Y'all.....The first time or two I had to not talk for a while, it was kind of an adventure! I felt like
                an advocate of sorts for people with differences. Look at me! I can't talk but I'm not letting that get
                in the way of going to the grocery store (or whatever)! And yes, perhaps interacting with me makes you
                uncomfortable. Suck it up.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is no longer a fun-ish adventure.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I'm tired of not being allowed to talk.&nbsp; Writing is slow. Typing is slow. The effort it takes to
                converse with people without speech gets old fast. And even just listening to someone! Conversation,
                even when dominated by one person, is a two-way interaction! The person listening makes noises - "oh",
                "uh-huh", "yes!", "ehhh," - asks clarifying questions, gives little comments of affirmation or empathy.
                Have you ever tried talking to someone and remaining utterly silent as they're sharing? It's WEIRD! Even
                if subconsciously, the other person gets the sense that you're not really listening, not really there.
                (There are certainly exceptions to this, sure.)</p>
            <p>Also, this comes as no surprise to any of you: I like to talk! I like connecting with people. I like
                telling stories with dramatic intonation and making people laugh. It is not fun to not be able to do
                that. (Ok, actually, I'm still pretty dang good at making people laugh even when I'm confined to paper
                and pencil. But again...it gets old.)</p>
            <p>I had agreed to go see a friend's child perform at an outdoor even today. Then I remembered I would be
                seeing people that I know there. None of them know I'm back on voice rest, so I'd have to explain, via
                gestures or writing/typing that I can't talk. Ugh. Sometimes, I have energy for that. Not tonight. So I
                stayed home.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It is interesting to see how people respond to me not being able to talk. It's slightly comical how many
                people - after reading "Hello! I'm not allowed to talk right now because I'm recovering from a surgery
                on my vocal cords" - initially forget that <em>they</em> are still able to speak. Or that I can still
                hear? After they remember they can talk to me and I can hear them, many people continue to outwardly
                display discomfort or confusion. I get it. It throws people off. Their reactions are understandable. I
                can handle it. And also...it gets old. It gets old knowing that when I leave the house, if I want to
                interact with any humans, I'm going to have to teach them how to interact with me. It gets old watching
                people feel uncomfortable because of me (even when the interaction ends well and maybe, in some way,
                I've helped them learn something). It gets old being extra smiley and chipper and nonchalant and patient
                so as to put people at ease. Sometimes I just want to buy orange juice and leave! It gets old having to
                choose between shortening everything I want to say to get it out faster or sitting there for ages to
                type/write everything I want to say. It's all very effortful and annoying. And, you guessed it: OLD! --
                Can you imagine having an <em>actual</em> disability that doesn't go away after a week (like my
                inability to speak does)? Something that you carry around all the time that makes people look at you
                differently or not know how to interact with you? Mad respect for everyone in the world who is
                differently-abled or disabled. --</p>
            <p>A few people I've encountered are pros. They treat me like a normal stranger. They adapt by asking yes-no
                questions. <em>Maybe</em>, if they're really good, they give me extra wait time before turning their
                attention elsewhere so that if I think of something else to say I don't have to tap them on the shoulder
                or wave awkwardly to get their attention again (since I can't just say "Pardon me.").</p>
            <p>My friends are great! They know the drill. They've gotten pretty good at having slow/choppy
                conversations. They know that when I type/write something to them, it helps for them to read it aloud so
                that I know they're reading the right thing and understanding it, or if they got tripped up by a typo or
                messy handwriting, etc. They delight in reading things with dramatic flair, just like I would say it,
                because it's fun and it makes me feel more like I have a voice. My housemates know that if they hear
                knocking or tapping, it's probably me trying to get their attention to "say" something to them.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>*But why are they great at this?! Why do they know these things?! Because I've taught them!! I've
                endlessly taught the people close to me how to adapt to my many medical <em>things</em>, how to care for
                me, how I want to be treated. That, in itself, becomes tiresome!! The refrain that has come up over and
                over again with my counselor is "I'm just <em>tired</em>." or "I'm so tired of ___." and "I just want
                something to be <em>easy.</em>" "I don't want to have to work so hard"*</p>
            <p>Even with great friends and family, the more days I've had to be silent, the more I've found myself
                retreating away from people.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Adding to all the social and logistical stuff: I can't freaking WORK! (Fortunately, seven years of being
                a self-denying tightwad have given me a luxurious financial cushion.) Not to mention all the other
                myriad things I can't do: call my grandma, call my parents, call my doctor, attend a job interview,
                answer any phone call from anyone, easily communicate anything to anyone in a timely fashion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Sigh.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Only four more days of silence to go. Then I have a week+ of being allowed to talk for work OR limited
                social/logistical speaking, but not both. If I work, I have to be silent the rest of the day. If I need
                my voice for a doctor's appointment and an interview, then I can't work the rest of the day. If I want
                to talk to my grandma on her NINETY-EIGHTH BIRTHDAY (Woo, Grandma!!), which requires raising my voice,
                then I can't talk to anyone else or work that day. And might even have to be totally silent the next
                day. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On the bright side: I have orange juice in the fridge and I've fallen in love with a telenovela that has
                86 episodes and neither of those delightful things requires talking. 😍</p>

            <p>I wrote this entry below on Thanksgiving of 2021 but for some reason didn't post it. I guess I had more I
                was going to add? Reading it again now, it's feels done enough to share. :) To add to the Thanksgiving
                vibes, attached is a picture of my friend, Polly, and me enjoying our Thanksgiving feast. We made
                ajiaco, which is a popular Colombian soup, and fresh jugo de tomate de árbol. Yum!!</p>
            <p>Happy belated Thanksgiving!</p>
            <p>- - - - - -&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just popping in to say that I am so thankful for all of you! You've supported me in more ways than I wish
                to list. Since I'm writing this on my Caring Bridge, though, I'd like to extend a special thank you
                simply for reading what I write. I can talk endlessly about my accident. And I kind of do. With friends
                and family, with acquaintances, and addressed in my journal. It's been therapeutic, though, to have this
                semi-public space to articulate my experiences and feelings throughout this wild ride. I know I don't do
                the best job of responding to your responses. :P But it is truly meaningful both to put my thoughts on a
                "page" and to know that someone else is reading them.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On a number of occasions recently, someone has asked me "are you recovered from your accident?" I find
                that difficult to answer. What does it mean to be "recovered?" Yes, most of my physical injuries are
                healed, or as healed as they are going to get, or healed enough to be functional. And yet, my physical
                body is not the same as it was before. And my emotional journey is a whole other element. I'm not the
                same person I was before my accident. My accident will be part of my life forever. Sometimes it seems
                like the implication of their question is "are you done (healing, processing, working to regain lost
                things, etc.)" and the answer to that is..."I guess mostly???" But also I still think about my accident
                or my recovery or the residual changes to my life pretty much every day. Does that mean I'm not
                recovered? Not done? Not "over it"?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I have a photo album in my phone called "The Crash." Basically every significant (and insignificant, if
                I'm being honest) photo of my life that I or someone I love has taken since May 13, 2020 is in that
                album. It currently has 1,396 photos in it. Many times I've thought to myself about when I will create a
                new album with a new title. I kept thinking "I'll make a new album when I'm done with _____." And then
                there'd be another Crash-related thing. Another procedure. Another milestone. I thought "I'll make a new
                album when The Crash feels like it's in the past." But that hasn't happened. Yeah, it's been a long
                time. Over a year and a half now. And I'm finally in a place where Crash stuff doesn't dominate my time.
                But it still feels like a thing that has shaped my present life. Is shaping my present life? I'm coming
                to realize that The Crash might not feel like a thing of the past for a very long time. Maybe it won't
                ever. It is literally written on my face, after all. I basically have a tattoo on my face that says
                "Something happened to me that isn't normal, and you can see it, and probably want to ask me about it,
                or maybe feel too uncomfortable to acknowledge it, but either way, it's there, and there's a very long
                story behind it." Fortunately it's a story I love to tell. (Come to think of it, it's been on my to-do
                list for a long time to tell the story of the day of The Crash here on my Caring Bridge page.)</p>

            <p>Today is May 13th, 2022. It's been two years since The Crash. A friend of mine asked me "does it feel
                like it's been that long?" I think my answer is both yes and no. On the one hand, I am finally in a
                place where my recovery from The Crash does not consume&nbsp;<em>all</em> my energy (which I am SO
                GRATEFUL for). It's been a long slog to get to that point, which I think makes The Crash feel like a
                long time ago. At the same time, my accident still feels like part of the present, so surely it couldn't
                have happened&nbsp;<em>two whole years&nbsp;</em>ago, right?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here are some unorganized reflections and updates because trying to summarize the last seven months (how
                did I seriously go&nbsp;<em>seven months</em> without posting anything on here?!) of my life feels too
                daunting and arduous:</p>
            <p>- I've stopped going to voice therapy. In part because I wasn't making much progress anymore but mostly
                because I didn't have the energy to keep making myself do my exercises. I think I'd like to try again
                someday, but I still don't have the drive for it right now. I do still get angry or sad sometimes about
                things that my voice can no longer do. Cheering and singing are the two things I find most
                frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Sometimes I feel robbed by all the time and energy I had to put into recovery rather than all the cool
                adventures I had planned for myself post-teaching. I know that most people experienced this to some
                degree because of the pandemic; I'm not the only one whose life was disrupted. But I had a double whammy
                of disruptions.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Other times I judge and shame myself for all the things I had planned and still haven't done. Or just
                generally struggle to not feel like a lame-o.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- When I reflect on my post-Crash journey, I can see lots of ways that journey has shaped me. For a very
                long time I could only identify negative things. I would get downright pissed off whenever anyone tried
                to point out some positive aspect or imply that in the end I'd be stronger or some shit like that. I
                once wrote in my journal something like:</p>
            <p><em>What are three things I've gained from this experience?</em></p>
            <p><em>1. Buncha</em></p>
            <p><em>2. Fucking</em></p>
            <p><em>3. Scars</em></p>
            <p>There are still certainly things that I don't like or wish I wouldn't have had to go through. My accident
                only worsened the sense that I never get to be free from physical pain and ailments. (Since my last post
                I've endured a freakish months-long outburst of hives, many bouts of back pain, a wrist injury called
                "intersection syndrome," and several other physical frustrations.) Sometimes I've thought&nbsp;<em>what
                    could I have done to warrant all this pain?&nbsp;</em> (Thank you Western society for teaching me
                that it must be my fault!) The Crash introduced all sorts of new fears and generally eroded my
                confidence in myself, my body, and the world. It made me feel like an unattractive or even <em>gross,
                    repulsive</em> being. It's taken a lot of time, dance, human connection, etc. to unravel that. I
                could keep going about all the crappy things. But even with all of that, and thanks to lots of therapy,
                I've also grown to be much more accepting of myself and of life in general. I have so much more
                compassion for myself than I used to, and I know that ripples out into how I interact with others as
                well. I'm gentler. I might be more patient. And I still have fantastic eyebrows, which is what really
                matters.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I'm working as an interpreter (and have been since November)! And I really like it! And it's not
                draining and stressful! And I'm pretty good at it! And I don't beat myself up for all the things I can
                improve on!</p>
            <p>- I'm still living in Harrisonburg, which I have entirely mixed feelings about. But mostly I do love my
                little Friendly City and my little house community and my cozy/tiny bedroom and the life I've created
                here in The Valley.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I went to Guatemala for three weeks and it was all kinds of wonderful, mostly in ways that I didn't
                expect.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Thank you so much for all the ways you all have supported me over the past two years!</p>
            <p>If any of you wishes to celebrate/commemorate my Crash-aversary with me, it would be really meaningful to
                me if you: (a) 🤳🏻 called your local elected official asking them to support universal healthcare or
                (b) 🚲 went on a bike ride (while wearing a helmet!!!) and sent me a picture. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>p.s. I can't figure out how to caption the photos so here are the captions:</p>
            <p>1. No more full face helmet! I bought a new helmet back in March and am so glad to not have to wear the
                other one anymore.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2. Wow. Them's some nice eyebrows.</p>
            <p>3. My current housemates, back at Christmas. I will dearly miss them when we all have to move out at the
                end of May.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4. Me posing before my first day of interpreting.</p>
            <p>5. Me midway up a steep-ass mountain in Guatemala (which eventually gave me altitude sickness which was
                super not fun but still a super cool experience overall).&nbsp;</p>

            Welcome to my CaringBridge website. &nbsp;In May of 2020 I wrecked my bike, sustained lots of injuries, and
            ended up being airlifted to a nearby hospital. This site was created by my mom when I was in the ICU as a
            more convenient way to keep lots of people updated on my progress. Once I came home, I took over and have
            since been using this site both to update loved ones and to process the many logistical and emotional
            struggles (and joys) throughout my recovery. Feel free to leave comments or ask questions. I love hearing
            from you all! Either way, thanks for stopping by and reading some of my often-rambly, heartfelt posts. :)
